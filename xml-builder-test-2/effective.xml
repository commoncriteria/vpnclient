      <comment>
        FIA_X509_EXT references to the Base-PPs are now removed and where appropriate the X.509 package is referenced instead. However, it's unclear whether there is still sufficient mechanism to actually 'force' the X.509 SFRs to be included. That is to say, there is nothing in here that says "because IPsec functionality is dependent on X.509 validation, and because the Base-PPs conform to the X.509 FP, the ST shall make the relevant X.509 FP claims."</comment>
      The scope of this Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) is to describe the security functionality of a virtual private network (VPN)
      client in terms of
      <xref g="CC"/>
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such
      products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>
          Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems (GPOS PP), Version 4.3
        </h:li>
        <h:li>
          Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF PP), Version 3.3
        </h:li>
        <h:li>
          Protection Profile for Application Software (App PP), Version 2.0
        </h:li>
        <h:li>
          Protection Profile for Mobile Device Management (MDM PP), Version 4.0
        </h:li>
      </h:ul>
      These Base-PPs are all valid because a VPN client may be a specific type of stand-alone software
      application or a built-in component of an operating system (OS), whether desktop or mobile. Regardless of
      which Base-PP is claimed, the VPN client functionality defined by this PP-Module will rely on the Base-PP.
      Sections 5.1 through 5.4 of this PP-Module describe the relevant functionality for each Base-PP,
      including specific selections and assignments, or inclusion of optional requirements that must be made as
      needed to support the VPN client functionality.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      The TOE defined by this PP-Module is the VPN client, a software application that runs on a physical or
      virtual host platform, used to establish a secure IPsec connection between that host platform and a
      remote system. The VPN client is intended to be located outside or inside of a private network, and
      establishes a secure tunnel to an IPsec peer. For the purposes of this PP-Module, IPsec peers are defined
      as:
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>
          VPN gateways
        </h:li>
        <h:li>
          Other VPN clients
        </h:li>
        <h:li>
          An IPsec-capable network device (supporting IPsec for the purposes of management)
        </h:li>
      </h:ul>
      The tunnel provides confidentiality, integrity, and data authentication for information that travels across
      a less trusted (sometimes public) network. All VPN clients that comply with this document will support
      IPsec.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      This PP-Module extends the GPOS PP when the VPN client is installed on an OS discussed
      in that PP (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This PP-Module extends the MDF PP when the VPN client is
      installed on a self-contained mobile device that is bundled with an OS (e.g. Android,
      BlackBerry OS, iOS, Windows Mobile). This PP-Module extends the App PP when the VPN client is
      provided by a third party and is a standalone application that is not a bundled part of an OS
      or mobile device. This PP-Module extends the MDM PP when the VPN client is included with
      MDM server software that is used for centralized deployment and administration of enterprise mobile
      device policies.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      As a PP-Module of any of these PPs, it is expected that the content of this PP-Module and the chosen
      Base-PP be appropriately combined in the context of each product-specific ST. This PP-Module has been specifically defined such that there should be no difficulty or ambiguity in doing so.
      When this PP-Module is used, conformant TOEs are obligated to implement the functionality required in
      the claimed Base-PP with the additional functionality defined in this PP-Module in response to the
      threat environment discussed in this PP-Module.
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        The TOE defined by this PP-Module is purely a software solution executing on a platform (some sort of
      OS running on hardware). Depending on the Base-PP claimed as part of the TOE, the
      platform may also be part of the TOE or it may be an environmental component that the TOE vendor has
      no control over. Regardless of whether the platform itself is within the scope of the evaluation, the VPN
      client itself will rely on the platform for its execution domain and proper usage. The vendor is expected
      to provide sufficient installation and configuration instructions to identify an Operational Environment (OE)
      with the necessary features and to provide instructions for how to configure it correctly.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        The PP-Module contains requirements that must be met by the TOE. Depending on the Base-PP that is
      claimed, there may be some variation in the applicable requirements. This is because a given Base-PP
      may include one or more requirements that the VPN client can inherit but are not shared between each
      possible Base-PP.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        This is somewhat different than other PPs, but addresses most implementations of VPN clients where
      some part of the functionality of the IPsec tunnel is provided by the platform. In terms of the
      cryptographic primitives (random bit generation, encryption and decryption, key generation, etc.) it is
      actually desirable that a well-tested implementation in the platform is used rather than trying to
      implement these functions in each client.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        Requirements that can be satisfied by either the TOE or the platform are identified in Section 5 by text
      such as “The [selection: TSF, TOE platform] shall…” The ST author will make the appropriate selection
      based on where that element is implemented. It is allowable for some elements in a component to be 
      implemented by the TOE, while other elements in that same component be implemented by the
      platform (requirements on the usage of X.509 certificates is an example of where this might be the case,
      where using the information contained in the certificates and the implementation of revocation
      checking may be done by the TOE, but storage and protection of the certificates may be done by the
      platform). Note that in the cases where this PP-Module is used to extend the GPOS PP or MDF PP, the
      TOE includes both the VPN client and the platform. In this case, it is appropriate to indicate that the TOE
      satisfies this requirement. However, the ST author should make it clear, for each of these components,
      which are implemented by the VPN client portion of the TOE versus the platform portion.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        A Supporting Document (SD) accompanies this PP-Module and contains guidance for how to evaluate the
requirements defined by the PP-Module, expressed as Evaluation Activities (EAs). EAs will differ
      based on where the function that meets the requirement is implemented. In most cases, requirements
      implemented by the platform will require that the evaluator examine documents pertaining to the
      platform (generally the ST), while requirements implemented by the TOE may require examination of
      the TSS, examination of the Operational Guidance, or execution of evaluator testing. For
      requirements implemented by the platform, there may also be requirements where the evaluator must
      examine the interfaces used by the TOE to access these functions on the platform. This ensures that the
      functionality being invoked to satisfy the requirements of this PP-Module is the same functionality that
      was evaluated.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        Given the degree of coupling between a VPN client and its underlying platform, it is expected that the
      client will be tested on each platform claimed in the ST. In cases where the platforms are simply
      different versions of the same OS (provided by the same platform vendor), an equivalency
      argument may be made in lieu of testing on each version. The argument would have to demonstrate
      that the client interacts in exactly the same way with the versions of the OS (i.e., the same APIs are used
      with the same parameters, the network stack is modified with exactly the same kernel modules). The
      evaluator shall use the operational guidance to configure the TOE and underlying platform.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        A TOE that conforms to this PP-Module will implement the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
      IPsec Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, RFC 4301, as well as
      the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol. IPsec ESP is specified in RFC 2406 and RFC 4303.
      The IPsec VPN client will support ESP in either tunnel mode, transport mode, or both.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        The IPsec VPN client will use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)v1 protocol, IKEv2, or both. IKEv1 is
      implemented as defined in RFCs 2407, 2408, 2409, and 4109, and IKEv2 is implemented as specified in RFC
      7296 and 4307 to authenticate
      and establish session keys with the VPN entities. The IKEv2 implementation also requires mandatory support for network address translation (NAT)
      traversal as specified in section 2.23 of RFC 7296.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        To show that the TSF implements the RFCs correctly, the evaluator shall perform the EAs
      documented in the SD that accompanies this PP-Module. In future versions of this
      PP-Module, EAs may be modified or new ones may be introduced that cover more aspects of RFC compliance
      than what is currently described in this publication.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        The IPsec VPN client enables encryption of all information that flows between itself and its IPsec peer.
      The VPN client serves as an endpoint for an IPsec VPN connection and performs a number of
      cryptographic functions related to establishing and maintaining that connection. If the cryptography
      used to perform endpoint authentication, generate keys, and encrypt information is sufficiently robust
      and the implementation has no critical design mistakes, an adversary will be unable to exhaust the
      encryption key space to obtain the data. Compliance with IPsec standards, use of a properly seeded
      Random Bit Generator (RBG), and secure authentication factors will ensure that access to the 
      transmitted information cannot be obtained with less work than a full exhaust of the key space. Any
      plaintext secret and private keys or other cryptographic security parameters will be zeroized when no
      longer in use to prevent disclosure of security critical data.
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>
    </section>
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      A VPN client allows users on the TOE platform to establish secure IPsec communications, providing
      confidentiality, integrity, and protection of data, across a less trusted network to secure data in
      transit. This PP-Module defines three use cases for VPN clients. A conformant TOE will implement one or
      more of the use cases specified below.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <usecases>
        <usecase title="TOE to VPN Gateway" id="usecase1">
          <description>
            A VPN client allows users on the TOE platform to establish an encrypted IPsec tunnel across a
            less trusted, often unprotected, public network to a private network (see ). In this case,
            the TOE provides encryption and decryption of network packets as they leave and arrive on the VPN client’s
            underlying platform. IP packets crossing from the private network to the public network will be
            encrypted if their destination is a remote access VPN client supporting the same VPN policy as
            the source network. 
            The TOE is responsible for encrypting the packets that are intended to be received by the target
            on the private network and then encapsulating these packets in a way that allows the VPN
            gateway to securely receive them and forward them to their final destination.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="TOE to VPN Client" id="usecase2">
          <description>
            A VPN client may additionally or alternatively allow a client computer to connect directly to
              another computer running a VPN client (see ). In this case, the functionality of the VPN
              client is to connect directly to another endpoint system to facilitate point-to-point communications with that system.
              IPsec transport mode is used for end-to-end communications. In this use case, the content of
              the packet data (payload) is encrypted but the original IP header is preserved. Inherent to this
              use case, when two peers are communicating directly, is the disclosure of the
              source and destination of the packets. Users should take into consideration any security risks
              associated with this disclosure when architecting their networks in line with this use case.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="TOE to IPsec-Capable Network Device" id="usecase3">
          <description>
            Similar to Use Case 2 above, a VPN client TOE can also be used to establish a secure connection
            to an IPsec-capable network device using IPsec, similar to how an SSH connection might be used. In this case,
            where a network device is being managed remotely over an IPsec connection, the network
            device itself must contain IPsec functionality to act as the peer for the connection (see ).
            
            While this will behave functionally the same way as the scenario described by Use Case 2, the
            user of the TOE in Use Case 3 is a network administrator who is assumed to have administrative
            access to the network device they are connecting to.

  <!-- 3.0 Security Problem Definition-->
  <sec:Security_Problem_Definition>
    The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address,
assumptions about its OE, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is
expected to enforce.
    <h:br/>
    <h:br/>
    This PP-Module is written to address the situation in which a user accesses a private network (e.g. the
    user’s office network) or terminal endpoint (e.g. a network device) using a less trusted network (such as
    a public Wi-Fi network or local area network). Protection of network packets is desired as they traverse
    a public network. To protect the data in transit from disclosure and modification, a VPN is created to
    establish secure communications. The VPN client provides one end of the secure VPN tunnel and
    performs encryption and decryption of network packets in accordance with a VPN security policy
    negotiated between the VPN client (TOE) and its IPsec peer.
    <h:br/>
    <h:br/>
    The proper installation and configuration of the VPN client is critical to its correct operation such that
    proper handling of the TOE by an administrator is also addressed.
    <h:br/>
    <h:br/>
    Note that as a PP-Module, all threats, assumptions, and organizational security policies (OSPs) defined in the Base-PP will also apply to a
    TOE unless otherwise specified, depending on which of the Base-PPs it extends. The SFRs
    defined in this PP-Module will mitigate the threats that are defined in the PP-Module but
    may also mitigate some threats defined in the Base-PPs in more comprehensive detail due to the
    specific capabilities provided by a VPN client.

      <threats>
        <threat name="T.TSF_CONFIGURATION">
          <description>
            Configuring VPN tunnels is a complex and time-consuming process, and prone to errors if the            interface for doing so is not well-specified or well-behaved. The inability or failure of an ignorant or careless administrator to configure certain aspects            of the interface may also lead to the incorrect specification of the desired communications policy or use            of cryptography that may be desired or required for a particular site. This may result in unintended            weak or plaintext communications while the user thinks that their data are being protected. Other            aspects of configuring the TOE or using its security mechanisms (for example, the update process)            may also result in a reduction in the trustworthiness of the VPN client.

        <threat name="T.TSF_FAILURE">
          <description>
            Security mechanisms of the TOE generally build up from a primitive set of mechanisms (e.g.,            memory management, privileged modes of process execution) to more complex sets of            mechanisms. Failure of the primitive mechanisms could lead to a compromise in more complex            mechanisms, resulting in a compromise of the TSF.

        <threat name="T.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS">
          <description>
            This PP-Module does not include requirements that can protect against an insider threat. Authorized            users are not considered hostile or malicious and are trusted to follow appropriate guidance. Only            authorized personnel should have access to the system or device that contains the IPsec VPN client.            Therefore, the primary threat agents are the unauthorized entities that try to gain access to the            protected network (in cases where tunnel mode is used) or to plaintext data that traverses the            public network (regardless of whether transport mode or tunnel mode is used).
            <h:br/>
            <h:br/>
            The endpoint of the network communication can be both geographically and logically distant from            the TOE and can pass through a variety of other systems. These intermediate systems may be under            the control of the adversary, and offer an opportunity for communications over the network to be            compromised.
            <h:br/>
            <h:br/>
            Plaintext communication over the network may allow critical data (such as passwords, configuration            settings, and user data) to be read or manipulated directly by a malicious user or process on intermediate systems, leading to            a compromise of the TOE or to the secured environmental systems that the TOE is being used to            facilitate communications with. IPsec can be used to provide protection for this communication;            however, there are numerous options that can be implemented for the protocol to be compliant to the            protocol specification listed in the RFC. Some of these options can have negative impacts on the            security of the connection. For instance, using a weak encryption algorithm (even one that is            allowed by the RFC, such as DES) can allow an adversary to read and even manipulate the data on            the encrypted channel, thus circumventing countermeasures in place to prevent such attacks.            Further, if the protocol is implemented with little-used or non-standard options, it may be compliant             with the protocol specification, but will not be able to interact with other diverse equipment that is            typically found in large enterprises.
            <h:br/>
            <h:br/>
            Even though the communication path is protected, there is a possibility that the IPsec peer could be            tricked into thinking that a malicious third-party user or system is the TOE. For instance, a            middleman could intercept a connection request to the TOE and respond to the request as if it were            the TOE. In a similar manner, the TOE could also be tricked into thinking that it is establishing            communications with a legitimate IPsec peer when in fact it is not. An attacker could also mount a            malicious man-in-the-middle-type of attack, in which an intermediate system is compromised, and            the traffic is proxied, examined, and modified by this system. This attack can even be mounted via            encrypted communication channels if appropriate countermeasures are not applied. These attacks            are, in part, enabled by a malicious attacker capturing network traffic (for instance, an            authentication session) and “playing back” that traffic in order to fool an endpoint into thinking it            was communicating with a legitimate remote entity.

            Data traversing the TOE could inadvertently be sent to a different user as a consequence of a poorly-designed TOE; since these data may be            sensitive, this may cause a compromise that is unacceptable. The specific threat that must be            addressed concerns user data that is retained by the TOE in the course of processing network traffic            that could be inadvertently reused in sending network traffic to a user other than that intended by            the sender of the original network traffic.

                This SFR is identical to what is defined in the App PP except that the selection for IPsec is
                mandated, the ST author is forced to select the "encrypt all transmitted sensitive data" option, and
                the options for invoking platform-provided IPsec functionality have been removed. Since it is possible for a conformant TOE to implement IPsec while relying on the platform for some other protocol (e.g., using platform-provided TLS to obtain IPsec configuration from a gateway), the other platform-provided protocol selections remain.  
                Additionally, since it is possible that a conformant TOE may not implement any encryption protocols other than 
                IPsec, “no other protocols” is provided as a selectable option in the list of supported protocols.

                Any security related information (such as keys, authentication data, and
                passwords) must be zeroized when no longer in use to prevent the disclosure or
                modification of security critical data.

                <h:br/>
                The zeroization indicated above applies to each intermediate storage area for
                plaintext key or CSP data (i.e., any storage, such as memory buffers, that is included in
                the path of such data) upon the transfer of the key or CSP to another location.
                <h:br/>
                <h:br/>
                In practice, the TOE will not implement all of the functionality associated with
                the requirement, since if it performs zeroization at all it will be by invoking
                platform interfaces to perform the storage location clear or overwrite function. The
                ST author should select "TOE" when, for at least one of the keys needed to meet
                the requirements of this PP-Module, the TOE manipulates (reads, writes) the data
                identified in the requirement and thus needs to ensure that those data are
                cleared. In these cases, it is sufficient for the TOE to invoke the correct
                underlying functions of the host to perform the zeroization—it does not imply
                that the TOE has to include a kernel-mode memory driver to ensure the data are
                zeroized. The ST author should select "TOE platform" when native OS functionality is used to perform the key destruction.

                In the likely event that some of the data are manipulated by the TOE and other
                data are manipulated entirely by the platform, the ST author must select both
                options.

              <h:p>
                When the MDM TOE claims this PP-Module, at least one of its interfaces will implement IPsec communications. However, this PP-Module does not specify that any one particular interface must be implemented using IPsec. If the TOE uses IPsec to secure communications between itself and external trusted IT entities, FTP_ITC.1/INTER_XFER_IT is refined as noted by the refinements above.
                <h:p/>
                This SFR is refined from its definition in the Base-PP by mandating that the “implement functionality” selection be chosen at minimum for IPsec and by prohibiting the TOE from relying on platform-provided IPsec functionality. Since the TOE may support multiple trusted channel interfaces, the ST author is given the option to select other protocols (SSH, TLS, DTLS, HTTPS) either as being implemented by the TSF or invoked from the platform. The "not invoke or implement any other protocol functionality" is added for the case where the TOE's implementation of IPsec is the only trusted channel protocol the TSF uses.

However, this PP-Module does not specify that any one particular interface must be implemented using IPsec. If the TOE uses IPsec to secure communications between itself and trusted remote administrators, FPT_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_REM_ADMIN is refined as below.

Since the TOE may support multiple remote administrative interfaces, the ST author is given the option to select other protocols (SSH, TLS, HTTPS) either as being implemented by the TSF or invoked from the platform. The "not invoke or implement any other protocol functionality" is added for the case where the TOE's implementation of IPsec is the only trusted path protocol the TSF uses.

      <con-toe>
        If this PP-Module is used to extend the MDM PP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a mobile device
		management solution. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include VPN client functionality that is
		included with the MDM software so that additional security functionality is claimed within the scope of
		the TOE.
      </con-toe>
      <con-sec-prob>
        The threats and assumptions defined by this PP-Module (see sections 3.1 and 3.2) supplement those
		defined in the MDM PP as follows:
      </con-sec-prob>
      <con-obj>
        The security objectives defined by this PP-Module (see sections 4.1 and 4.2) supplement those defined
		in the MDM PP as follows:
      </con-obj>
      <con-op-en/>
      <con-mod ref="T.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS">
        The threat of an attacker gaining access to a network interface or data
		that is transmitted over it is consistent with the T.NETWORK_ATTACK and
		T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP threats in the MDM PP.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="T.TSF_CONFIGURATION">
        The threat of a misconfigured VPN client is consistent with the
		T.NETWORK_ATTACK and T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP threats in the MDM
		PP because failure to mitigate against misconfiguration makes these
		threats more significant.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="T.USER_DATA_REUSE">
        Inadvertent disclosure of user data to an unauthorized recipient is
		consistent with the T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP threat in the MDM PP.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="T.TSF_FAILURE">
        A failure of TSF functionality could compromise the implementation of the
		IPsec channel, which would lead to an exploitation of the T.NETWORK_ATTACK threat.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="A.NO_TOE_BYPASS">
        The A.NO_TOE_BYPASS assumption assumes that the OE is configured in such a manner that the only network route
		to the protected network is through the TOE. This does not conflict with
		the MDM PP because the MDM PP makes no assumptions about the
		network architecture in which the TOE is deployed.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="A.PHYSICAL">
        The assumption that physical security is provided by the environment is
		not explicitly stated in the MDM PP but is consistent with the A.MDM_SERVER_PLATFORM assumption defined in the MDM PP, which
		expects the computing platform to be trusted.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="A.TRUSTED_CONFIG">
        The assumption that personnel responsible for the TOE’s configuration are
		trusted to follow the guidance is consistent with the A.PROPER_ADMIN
		defined in the MDM PP.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="OE.NO_TOE_BYPASS">
        This objective addresses behavior that is out of scope of the MDM PP
		and does not define an environment that an MDM TOE is incapable
		of existing in.
      </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="OE.PHYSICAL">
        This is part of satisfying OE.IT_ENTERPRISE as defined in the MDM
		PP because provisioning of physical security is a reasonable
		expectation for an IT enterprise.

      <con-mod ref="OE.TRUSTED_CONFIG">
        The expectation of trusted configuration is consistent with

        <h:td>
          FCS_CKM.1 (which is defined in this PP-Module as FCS_CKM.1/VPN) requires one of FCS_CKM.2 or FCS_COP.1 to be claimed so that the generated keys can serve some security-relevant purpose. Each of the Base-PPs for this PP-Module define an iteration of FCS_COP.1 for symmetric cryptography that is expected to use the IKE keys generated by FCS_CKM.1/VPN. Therefore, this dependency is satisfied through requirements defined in the Base-PPs.

        <h:td>
          FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 has a dependency on FCS_COP.1 because of the cryptographic operations that are needed in support of implementing the IPsec protocol. FCS_COP.1 is not defined in this PP-Module because each of the supported Base-PPs define iterations of FCS_COP.1 that support the functions that are relevant to IPsec.

        <h:td>
          FAU_SEL.1/VPN has a dependency on FMT_MTD.1 to enforce appropriate access controls on the audit configuration, as this is TSF data. This SFR is not explicitly defined in any of the supported Base-PPs but the dependency is implicitly addressed by each Base-PP in the following manner:
          <h:ul>
            <h:li>
              GPOS PP: The GPOS PP implicitly defines the existence of ‘user’ and ‘administrator’ roles in the extended SFRs FMT_MOF_EXT.1 and FMT_SMF_EXT.1. A TOE that conforms to this Base-PP can associate the ability to perform the functionality defined by FAU_SEL.1/VPN to one or both of these roles.
            </h:li>
            <h:li>
              MDF PP: The MDF PP implicitly defines the existence of ‘user,’ ‘administrator,’ and ‘MDM’ roles in the SFRs FMT_MOF_EXT.1 and FMT_SMF.1. A TOE that conforms to this Base-PP can associate the ability to perform the functionality defined by FAU_SEL.1/VPN to one or more of these roles.
            </h:li>
            <h:li>
              App PP: The App PP does not define the existence of a separately authenticated management interface; instead, the App PP assumes that authentication to the underlying OS platform is sufficient authorization to access the application’s management functionality.
            </h:li>
            <h:li>
              MDM PP: The MDM PP defines the existence of management roles in FMT_SMR.1/SECMAN_ROLES. A TOE that conforms to this Base-PP can associate the ability to perform the functionality defined by FAU_SEL.1/VPN to one or more of the roles defined here.
            </h:li>
          </h:ul>

            FPT_STM.1 – Reliable Time Stamps
          </h:b>
        </h:td>
        <h:td>
          FAU_GEN.1/VPN has a dependency on FPT_STM.1 because audit data is required to have timestamps that are based on reliable clock data. All of the supported Base-PPs either define this requirement explicitly or provide rationale for why the reader should expect that a reliable clock service should be present. Depending on the claimed Base-PP, the dependency is satisfied in the following manner:
          <h:ul>
            <h:li>
              GPOS PP: The GPOS PP states that FPT_STM.1 is implicitly satisfied by the requirements of FAU_GEN.1 since that requirement could not be satisfied if no clock service was present. Additionally, a clock service is reasonably assumed to be provided by a general-purpose OS.
            </h:li>
            <h:li>
              MDF PP: The MDF PP explicitly defines FPT_STM.1.
            </h:li>
            <h:li>
              App PP: The App PP assumption A.PLATFORM assumes that the general-purpose computing platform on which the TOE is installed is ‘a trustworthy computing platform.’ System time data is not explicitly mentioned but a clock service is reasonably assumed to be provided by a general-purpose computer.
            </h:li>
            <h:li>
              MDM PP: The MDM PP assumption A.MDM_SERVER_PLATFORM assumes that the platform on which the TOE is installed will provide reliable time services.
            </h:li>
          </h:ul>
        </h:td>
      </h:tr>
      <h:tr>
        <h:td>
          <h:b>
            FPT_STM.1 – Reliable Time Stamps
          </h:b>
        </h:td>
        <h:td>
          FAU_GEN.1 has a dependency on FPT_STM.1. While not explicitly stated in the PP, it is assumed that this will be provided by the underlying hardware platform on which the TOE is installed. This is because the TOE is installed as a software or firmware product that runs on general-purpose computing hardware so a hardware clock is assumed to be available.
        </h:td>
      </h:tr>
    </h:table>
  </appendix>
  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="app-ent">
    The TOE does not require any additional supplementary information to describe its entropy sources beyond the requirements outlined in the Base-PPs. As with other Base-PP requirements, the only additional requirement is that the entropy documentation also applies to the specific VPN client capabilities of the TOE in addition to the functionality required by the claimed Base-PP.
